// TODO: Define a base class named `Person`, with `first_name` and `last_name` attributes, set
//  by the constructor. It should be possible to access the `first_name` and `last_name` attributes
//  of a `Person`.
//  `Person` should also have a method named `full_name` that returns the full name of the person.
//  Then define a subclass named `Employee` that inherits from `Person` and adds an
//  unsigned integer `id` attribute and a constructor that sets the `id` attribute.
//  It should be possible to access the `first_name`, `last_name` and `id`
//  attributes of an `Employee`.
