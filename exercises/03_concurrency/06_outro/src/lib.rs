#[pyfunction]
/// Given a starting URL (`start_from`), discover all the URLs *on the same domain*
/// that can be reached by following links from the starting URL.
///
/// The discovered URLs should be inserted into the `site_map` set provided as an argument.
///
/// # Constraints
///
/// ## GIL
///
/// You should, as much as possible, avoid holding the GIL.
/// Try to scope the GIL to the smallest possible block of codeâ€”e.g. when touching `site_map`.
///
/// ## Threads
///
/// The program should use as many threads as there are available cores on the machine.
///
/// ## Invalid URLs
///
/// If a URL is invalid (e.g. it's malformed or it returns a 404 status code), ignore it.
///
/// ## External URLs
///
/// Do not follow links to external websites. Restrict your search to the domain of the
/// starting URL.
///
/// ## Anchors and Query Parameters
///
/// Ignore anchors and query parameters when comparing URLs.
/// E.g. `http://example.com` and `http://example.com#section` should be considered the same URL,
/// and normalizing them to `http://example.com` is the expected approach.
///
/// # Tooling
///
/// We recommend using the following crates to help you with this exercise:
///
/// - `ureq` for making HTTP requests (https://crates.io/crates/ureq)
/// - `scraper` for parsing HTML and extracting links (https://crates.io/crates/scraper)
/// - `url` for parsing URLs (https://crates.io/crates/url)
/// - `std`'s `sync` and `thread` modules for synchronization primitives.
///
/// Feel free to pull in any other crates you think might be useful.
/// If your approach is channel-based, you might want to use the `crossbeam` crate too.
